    Privacy Policy for [Your App Name]
Last updated: [July 03, 2025]
Sruthi ("we," "us," or "our") built the Eazy-Calculator app. This application is provided by us at no cost and is intended for use as is.
This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Service.
Information Collection and Use
Our application is designed with your privacy at its core.
We want to be crystal clear: We do not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information from you while you use our application.
All data created or used by the app (such as calculations, settings, or history) is stored locally on your device and is never sent to us or any third party. The app functions entirely offline and does not require an internet connection for its core features.
Permissions
The Eazy-Calculator app may request certain permissions to function correctly. These permissions are used only for the stated purpose within the app and not for collecting any personal data.
(Note: If your app requires NO permissions, you can remove this section or state: "Our app requires no special permissions to operate.")
Third-Party Services
Our application does not use any third-party services, such as advertising networks or analytics platforms, that could collect information from you.
Children's Privacy
Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. Since our application does not collect any personal data whatsoever, it is inherently safe for all users, including children.
Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
Changes to this privacy policy are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.

If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us.
